1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is useful for collaboration and provides a back in case something happens to your local machine.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having GitHub automatically pull changes could result in incomplete files being uploaded publicly.
